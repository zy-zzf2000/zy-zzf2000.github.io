              <p>预测十年之后集成电路的发展情况<br>
With unit cost falling as the number of components per circuit rises, by 1975 economics may dictate squeezing as many as 65 000 components on a single silicon chip.</p>
<p>集成电路的应用会扩展到许多新领域<br>
The future of integrated electronics is the future of electronics itself. The advantages of integration will bring about a proliferation of electronics, pushing this science into many new areas.</p>
<p>具体的例子<br>
Integrated circuits will lead to such wonders as home computers—or at least terminals connected to a central computer—automatic controls for automobiles, and personal portable communications equipment. The electronic wristwatch needs only a display to be feasible today.</p>
<p>最大的潜力在于大型系统的生产<br>
But the biggest potential lies in the production of large systems. In telephone communications, integrated circuits in digital filters will separate channels on multiplex equipment. Integrated circuits will also switch telephone circuits and perform data processing.</p>
<p>对于计算机的影响<br>
Computers will be more powerful, and will be organized in completely different ways. For example, memories built of integrated electronics may be distributed throughout the machine instead of being concentrated in a central unit. In addition, the improved reliability made possible by integrated circuits will allow the construction of larger processing units. Machines similar to those in existence today will be built at lower costs and with faster turnaround.</p>
<p>I. PRESENT AND FUTURE<br>
将集成电路集成化程度提高的几个方法，以及未来的发展趋势是几个方法的融合<br>
By integrated electronics, I mean all the various technologies which are referred to as microelectronics today as well as any additional ones that result in electronics functions supplied to the user as irreducible units. These technologies were first investigated in the late 1950’s. The object was to miniaturize electronics equipment to include increasingly complex electronic functions in limited space with minimum weight. Several approaches evolved, including microassembly techniques for individual components, thin-film structures, and semiconductor integrated circuits.<br>
Each approach evolved rapidly and converged so that each borrowed techniques from another. Many researchers believe the way of the future to be a combination of the various approaches.</p>
<p>The advocates of semiconductor integrated circuitry are already using the improved characteristics of thin-film resistors by applying such films directly to an active semiconductor substrate. Those advocating a technology based upon films are developing sophisticated techniques for the attachment of active semiconductor devices to the passive film arrays.</p>
<p>Both approaches have worked well and are being used in equipment today.</p>
<p>II. THE ESTABLISHMENT<br>
主要叙述了集成电子学相对于包括晶体管在内的传统电子制造的优势<br>
Integrated electronics is established today. Its techniques are almost mandatory for new military systems, since the reliability, size, and weight required by some of them is achievable only with integration. Such programs as Apollo, for manned moon flight, have demonstrated the reliability of integrated electronics by showing that complete circuit functions are as free from failure as the best individual transistors</p>
<p>Most companies in the commercial computer field have machines in design or in early production employing integrated electronics. These machines cost less and perform better than those which use “conventional” electronics.</p>
<p>Instruments of various sorts, especially the rapidly increasing numbers employing digital techniques, are starting to use integration because it cuts costs of both manufacture and design.</p>
<p>The use of linear integrated circuitry is still restricted primarily to the military. Such integrated functions are expensive and not available in the variety required to satisfy a major fraction of linear electronics. But the first applications are beginning to appear in commercial electronics, particularly in equipment which needs low-frequency amplifiers of small size.</p>
<p>III. RELIABILITY COUNTS<br>
In almost every case, integrated electronics has demonstrated high reliability. Even at the present level of production—low compared to that of discrete components—it offers reduced systems cost, and in many systems improved performance has been realized.</p>
<p>Integrated electronics will make electronic techniques more generally available throughout all of society, performing many functions that presently are done inadequately by other techniques or not done at all. The principal advantages will be lower costs and greatly simplified design—payoffs<br>
from a ready supply of low-cost functional packages.</p>
<p>For most applications, semiconductor integrated circuits will predominate. Semiconductor devices are the only reasonable candidates presently in existence for the active elements of integrated circuits. Passive semiconductor elements look attractive too, because of their potential for<br>
low cost and high reliability, but they can be used only if precision is not a prime requisite.</p>
<p>Silicon is likely to remain the basic material, although others will be of use in specific applications. For example, gallium arsenide will be important in integrated microwave functions. But silicon will predominate at lower frequencies because of the technology which has already evolved<br>
around it and its oxide, and because it is an abundant and relatively inexpensive starting material.</p>
<p>IV. COSTS AND CURVES<br>
Reduced cost is one of the big attractions of integrated<br>
electronics, and the cost advantage continues to increase<br>
as the technology evolves toward the production of larger<br>
and larger circuit functions on a single semiconductor<br>
substrate. For simple circuits, the cost per component is<br>
nearly inversely proportional to the number of components,<br>
the result of the equivalent piece of semiconductor in<br>
the equivalent package containing more components. But<br>
as components are added, decreased yields more than<br>
compensate for the increased complexity, tending to raise<br>
the cost per component. Thus there is a minimum cost<br>
at any given time in the evolution of the technology. At<br>
present, it is reached when 50 components are used per<br>
circuit. But the minimum is rising rapidly while the entire<br>
cost curve is falling (see graph). If we look ahead five<br>
years, a plot of costs suggests that the minimum cost per<br>
component might be expected in circuits with about 1000<br>
components per circuit (providing such circuit functions<br>
can be produced in moderate quantities). In 1970, the<br>
manufacturing cost per component can be expected to be<br>
only a tenth of the present cost.</p>
<p>The complexity for minimum component costs has increased at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year<br>
(see graph). Certainly over the short term this rate can be<br>
expected to continue, if not to increase. Over the longer<br>
term, the rate of increase is a bit more uncertain, although<br>
there is no reason to believe it will not remain nearly<br>
constant for at least ten years. That means by 1975, the<br>
number of components per integrated circuit for minimum<br>
cost will be 65 000.</p>
<p>I believe that such a large circuit can be built on a single<br>
wafer</p>
<p>V. TWO-MIL SQUARES<br>
With the dimensional tolerances already being employed<br>
in integrated circuits, isolated high-performance transistors<br>
can be built on centers two-thousandths of an inch apart.<br>
Such a two-mil square can also contain several kilohms<br>
of resistance or a few diodes. This allows at least 500<br>
components per linear inch or a quarter million per square<br>
inch. Thus, 65 000 components need occupy only about<br>
one-fourth a square inch.</p>
<p>On the silicon wafer currently used, usually an inch or<br>
more in diameter, there is ample room for such a structure if<br>
the components can be closely packed with no space wasted<br>
for interconnection patterns. This is realistic, since efforts to<br>
achieve a level of complexity above the presently available<br>
integrated circuits are already under way using multilayer<br>
metallization patterns separated by dielectric films. Such a<br>
density of components can be achieved by present optical<br>
techniques and does not require the more exotic techniques,<br>
such as electron beam operations, which are being studied<br>
to make even smaller structures.</p>
